A suite of little handy tools we developed during 128T Commissioning.
So far as possible they depend on as little else of the infrastructure
running so they can be used when the system is barely alive.

The various executables and things here shuold be soft-linked into the /home/mwa/bin directory
of the machine you intend to use them on (eg. helios or cerberus).
