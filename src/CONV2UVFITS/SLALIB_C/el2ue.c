**
**  Notes
**
**  1  The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
**     purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference).
**     They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
**     and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
**     at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
**     quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
**     information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
**     computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
**     are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
**     orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
**     outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
**     estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
**     date and (v) that date.
**
**  2  The companion routine is slaUe2pv.  This takes the set of numbers
**     that the present routine outputs and uses them to derive the
**     object's position and velocity.  A single prediction requires one
**     call to the present routine followed by one call to slaUe2pv;
**     for convenience, the two calls are packaged as the routine
**     slaPlanel.  Multiple predictions may be made by again calling the
**     present routine once, but then calling slaUe2pv multiple times,
**     which is faster than multiple calls to slaPlanel.
**
**  3  date is the epoch of osculation.  It is in the TT timescale
**     (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET) and is a Modified Julian Date
**     (JD-2400000.5).
**
**  4  The supplied orbital elements are with respect to the J2000
**     ecliptic and equinox.  The position and velocity parameters
**     returned in the array u are with respect to the mean equator and
**     equinox of epoch J2000, and are for the perihelion prior to the
**     specified epoch.
**
**  5  The universal elements returned in the array u are in canonical
**     units (solar masses, AU and canonical days).
**
**  6  Three different element-format options are available:
**
**     Option jform=1, suitable for the major planets:
**
**     epoch  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
**     orbinc = inclination i (radians)
**     anode  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
**     perih  = longitude of perihelion, curly pi (radians)
**     aorq   = mean distance, a (AU)
**     e      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
**     aorl   = mean longitude L (radians)
**     dm     = daily motion (radians)
**
**     Option jform=2, suitable for minor planets:
**
**     epoch  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
**     orbinc = inclination i (radians)
**     anode  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
**     perih  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
**     aorq   = mean distance, a (AU)
**     e      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
**     aorl   = mean anomaly M (radians)
**
**     Option jform=3, suitable for comets:
**
**     epoch  = epoch of perihelion (TT MJD)
**     orbinc = inclination i (radians)
**     anode  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
**     perih  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
**     aorq   = perihelion distance, q (AU)
**     e      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to 10)
**
**  7  Unused elements (dm for jform=2, aorl and dm for jform=3) are
**     not accessed.
**
**  8  The algorithm was originally adapted from the EPHSLA program of
**     D.H.P.Jones (private communication, 1996).  The method is based on
**     Stumpff's Universal Variables.
