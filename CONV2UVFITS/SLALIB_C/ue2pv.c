**  Notes
**
**  1  The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
**     purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference).
**     They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
**     and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
**     at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
**     quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
**     information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
**     computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
**     are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
**     orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
**     outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
**     estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
**     date and (v) that date.
**
**  2  The companion routine is slaEl2ue.  This takes the conventional
**     orbital elements and transforms them into the set of numbers
**     needed by the present routine.  A single prediction requires one
**     one call to slaEl2ue followed by one call to the present routine;
**     for convenience, the two calls are packaged as the routine
**     slaPlanel.   Multiple predictions may be made by again calling
**     slaEl2ue once, but then calling the present routine multiple times,
**     which is faster than multiple calls to slaPlanel.
**
**     It is not obligatory to use slaEl2ue to obtain the parameters.
**     However, it should be noted that because slaEl2ue performs its
**     own validation, no checks on the contents of the array U are made
**     by the present routine.
**
**  3  date is the instant for which the prediction is required.  It is
**     in the TT timescale (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET) and is a
**     Modified Julian Date (JD-2400000.5).
**
**  4  The universal elements supplied in the array u are in canonical
**     units (solar masses, AU and canonical days).  The position and
**     velocity are not sensitive to the choice of reference frame.  The
**     slaEl2ue routine in fact produces coordinates with respect to the
**     J2000 equator and equinox.
**
**  5  The algorithm was originally adapted from the EPHSLA program of
**     D.H.P.Jones (private communication, 1996).  The method is based
**     on Stumpff's Universal Variables.
