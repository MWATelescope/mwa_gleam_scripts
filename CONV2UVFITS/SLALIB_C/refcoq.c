**
**  Determine the constants A and B in the atmospheric refraction
**  model dZ = A tan Z + B tan^3 Z.  This is a fast alternative
**  to the slaRefco routine - see notes.
**
**  Z is the "observed" zenith distance (i.e. affected by refraction)
**  and dZ is what to add to Z to give the "topocentric" (i.e. in vacuo)
**  zenith distance.
**
**  Given:
**    tdk    double    ambient temperature at the observer (K)
**    pmb    double    pressure at the observer (millibar)
**    rh     double    relative humidity at the observer (range 0-1)
**    wl     double    effective wavelength of the source (micrometre)
**
**  Returned:
**    refa   double*   tan Z coefficient (radian)
**    refb   double*   tan^3 Z coefficient (radian)
**
**  The radio refraction is chosen by specifying WL > 100 micrometres.
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1  The model is an approximation, for moderate zenith distances,
**     to the predictions of the slaRefro routine.  The approximation
**     is maintained across a range of conditions, and applies to
**     both optical/IR and radio.
**
**  2  The algorithm is a fast alternative to the slaRefco routine.
**     The latter calls the slaRefro routine itself:  this involves
**     integrations through a model atmosphere, and is costly in
**     processor time.  However, the model which is produced is precisely
**     correct for two zenith distance (45 degrees and about 76 degrees)
**     and at other zenith distances is limited in accuracy only by the
**     A tan Z + B tan^3 Z formulation itself.  The present routine
**     is not as accurate, though it satisfies most practical
**     requirements.
**
**  3  The model omits the effects of (i) height above sea level (apart
**     from the reduced pressure itself), (ii) latitude (i.e. the
**     flattening of the Earth) and (iii) variations in tropospheric
**     lapse rate.
**
**     The model was tested using the following range of conditions:
**
**       lapse rates 0.0055, 0.0065, 0.0075 deg/metre
**       latitudes 0, 25, 50, 75 degrees
**       heights 0, 2500, 5000 metres ASL
**       pressures mean for height -10% to +5% in steps of 5%
**       temperatures -10 deg to +20 deg with respect to 280 deg at SL
**       relative humidity 0, 0.5, 1
**       wavelengths 0.4, 0.6, ... 2 micron, + radio
**       zenith distances 15, 45, 75 degrees
**
**     The accuracy with respect to direct use of the slaRefro routine
**     was as follows:
**
**                            worst         RMS
**
**       optical/IR           62 mas       8 mas
**       radio               319 mas      49 mas
**
**     For this particular set of conditions:
**
**       lapse rate 0.0065 K/metre
**       latitude 50 degrees
**       sea level
**       pressure 1005 mb
**       temperature 280.15 K
**       humidity 80%
**       wavelength 5740 Angstroms
**

**
**     The values for Saastamoinen's formula (which includes terms
**     up to tan^5) are taken from Hohenkerk and Sinclair (1985).
**
**     The results from the much slower but more accurate slaRefco
**     routine have not been included in the tabulation as they are
**     identical to those in the slaRefro column to the 0.01 arcsec
**     resolution used.
**
**  4  Outlandish input parameters are silently limited to mathematically
**     safe values.  Zero pressure is permissible, and causes zeroes to
**     be returned.
**
**  5  The algorithm draws on several sources, as follows:
**
**     a) The formula for the saturation vapour pressure of water as
**        a function of temperature and temperature is taken from
**        expressions A4.5-A4.7 of Gill (1982).
**
**     b) The formula for the water vapour pressure, given the
**        saturation pressure and the relative humidity, is from
**        Crane (1976), expression 2.5.5.
**
**     c) The refractivity of air is a function of temperature,
**        total pressure, water-vapour pressure and, in the case
**        of optical/IR but not radio, wavelength.  The formulae
**        for the two cases are developed from Hohenkerk & Sinclair
**        (1985) and Rueger (2002).
**
**     The above three items are as used in the slaRefro routine.
**
**     d) The formula for beta, the ratio of the scale height of the
**        atmosphere to the geocentric distance of the observer, is
**        an adaption of expression 9 from Stone (1996).  The
**        adaptations, arrived at empirically, consist of (i) a
**        small adjustment to the coefficient and (ii) a humidity
**        term for the radio case only.
**
**     e) The formulae for the refraction constants as a function of
**        n-1 and beta are from Green (1987), expression 4.31.
