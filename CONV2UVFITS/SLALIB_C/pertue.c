**  Notes:
**
**  1  The "universal" elements are those which define the orbit for the
**     purposes of the method of universal variables (see reference 2).
**     They consist of the combined mass of the two bodies, an epoch,
**     and the position and velocity vectors (arbitrary reference frame)
**     at that epoch.  The parameter set used here includes also various
**     quantities that can, in fact, be derived from the other
**     information.  This approach is taken to avoiding unnecessary
**     computation and loss of accuracy.  The supplementary quantities
**     are (i) alpha, which is proportional to the total energy of the
**     orbit, (ii) the heliocentric distance at epoch, (iii) the
**     outwards component of the velocity at the given epoch, (iv) an
**     estimate of psi, the "universal eccentric anomaly" at a given
**     date and (v) that date.
**
**  2  The universal elements are with respect to the J2000 equator and
**     equinox.
**
**  3  The epochs date, u[2] and u[11] are all Modified Julian Dates
**     (JD-2400000.5).
**
**  4  The algorithm is a simplified form of Encke's method.  It takes as
**     a basis the unperturbed motion of the body, and numerically
**     integrates the perturbing accelerations from the major planets.
**     The expression used is essentially Sterne's 6.7-2 (reference 1).
**     Everhart and Pitkin (reference 2) suggest rectifying the orbit at
**     each integration step by propagating the new perturbed position
**     and velocity as the new universal variables.  In the present
**     routine the orbit is rectified less frequently than this, in order
**     to gain a slight speed advantage.  However, the rectification is
**     done directly in terms of position and velocity, as suggested by
**     Everhart and Pitkin, bypassing the use of conventional orbital
**     elements.
**
**     The f(q) part of the full Encke method is not used.  The purpose
**     of this part is to avoid subtracting two nearly equal quantities
**     when calculating the "indirect member", which takes account of the
**     small change in the Sun's attraction due to the slightly displaced
**     position of the perturbed body.  A simpler, direct calculation in
**     double precision proves to be faster and not significantly less
**     accurate.
**
**     Apart from employing a variable timestep, and occasionally
**     "rectifying the orbit" to keep the indirect member small, the
**     integration is done in a fairly straightforward way.  The
**     acceleration estimated for the middle of the timestep is assumed
**     to apply throughout that timestep;  it is also used in the
**     extrapolation of the perturbations to the middle of the next
**     timestep, to predict the new disturbed position.  There is no
**     iteration within a timestep.
**
**     Measures are taken to reach a compromise between execution time
**     and accuracy.  The starting-point is the goal of achieving
**     arcsecond accuracy for ordinary minor planets over a ten-year
**     timespan.  This goal dictates how large the timesteps can be,
**     which in turn dictates how frequently the unperturbed motion has
**     to be recalculated from the osculating elements.
**
**     Within predetermined limits, the timestep for the numerical
**     integration is varied in length in inverse proportion to the
**     magnitude of the net acceleration on the body from the major
**     planets.
**
**     The numerical integration requires estimates of the major-planet
**     motions.  Approximate positions for the major planets (Pluto
**     alone is omitted) are obtained from the routine slaPlanet.  Two
**     levels of interpolation are used, to enhance speed without
**     significantly degrading accuracy.  At a low frequency, the routine
**     slaPlanet is called to generate updated position+velocity "state
**     vectors".  The only task remaining to be carried out at the full
**     frequency (i.e. at each integration step) is to use the state
**     vectors to extrapolate the planetary positions.  In place of a
**     strictly linear extrapolation, some allowance is made for the
**     curvature of the orbit by scaling back the radius vector as the
**     linear extrapolation goes off at a tangent.
**
**     Various other approximations are made.  For example, perturbations
**     by Pluto and the minor planets are neglected and relativistic
**     effects are not taken into account.
**
**     In the interests of simplicity, the background calculations for
**     the major planets are carried out en masse.  The mean elements and
**     state vectors for all the planets are refreshed at the same time,
**     without regard for orbit curvature, mass or proximity.
**
**     The Earth-Moon system is treated as a single body when the body is
**     distant but as separate bodies when closer to the EMB than the
**     parameter RNE, which incurs a time penalty but improves accuracy
**     for near-Earth objects.
**
**  5  This routine is not intended to be used for major planets.
**     However, if major-planet elements are supplied, sensible results
**     will, in fact, be produced.  This happens because the routine
**     checks the separation between the body and each of the planets and
**     interprets a suspiciously small value (0.001 AU) as an attempt to
**     apply the routine to the planet concerned.  If this condition is
**     detected, the contribution from that planet is ignored, and the
**     status is set to the planet number (1-10 = Mercury, Venus, EMB,
**     Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Earth, Moon) as a warning.
